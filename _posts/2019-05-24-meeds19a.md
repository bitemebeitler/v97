abstract: 'We introduce a flexible, scalable Bayesian inference framework for nonlinear
  dynamical systems characterised by distinct and hierarchical variability at the
  individual, group, and population levels. Our model class is a generalisation of
  nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) dynamical systems, the statistical workhorse for
  many experimental sciences. We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation
  of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. We specify
  the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation
  (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. This model
  class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed
  or "white-box" sub-components and neural network or "black-box" sub-components.
  Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly
  scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation).
  Finally, our framework supports interpretability with respect to the underlying
  dynamics, as well as predictive generalization to unseen combinations of group components
  (also called â€œzero-shot" learning). We empirically validate our method by predicting
  the dynamic behaviour of bacteria that were genetically engineered to function as
  biosensors.'
