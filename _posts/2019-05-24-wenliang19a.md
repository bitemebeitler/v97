abstract: 'The kernel exponential family is a rich class of distributions, which can
  be fit efficiently and with statistical guarantees by score matching. Being required
  to choose a priori a simple kernel such as the Gaussian, however, limits its practical
  applicability. We provide a scheme for learning a kernel parameterized by a deep
  network, which can find complex location-dependent local features of the data geometry.
  This gives a very rich class of density models, capable of fitting complex structures
  on moderate-dimensional problems. Compared to deep density models fit via maximum
  likelihood, our approach provides a complementary set of strengths and tradeoffs:
  in empirical studies, the former can yield higher likelihoods, whereas the latter
  gives better estimates of the gradient of the log density, the score, which describes
  the distributionâ€™s shape.'
